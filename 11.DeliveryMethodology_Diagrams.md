# Section 11: Delivery and Implementation Methodology – Diagrams

This file defines the visuals for Section 11. These diagrams must show enterprise-grade rigor in delivery, with clarity around phased methodology and governance. The audience should feel that our process is structured, auditable, and risk-controlled.

Illustrate the phased delivery approach from discovery to steady state, emphasizing checkpoints, deliverables, and governance. The diagram should look like a structured project lifecycle used by top consulting firms.

### Canvas Layout
Horizontal timeline with seven phases, each separated by gate symbols (sign-off checkpoints). Icons and short captions under each phase.

### Elements to Show
1. **Discovery & Blueprint**
   - Icon: magnifying glass.
   - Caption: Requirements, system landscape, blueprint.
   - Deliverable: Blueprint Document.
2. **Solution Design**
   - Icon: architect’s compass.
   - Caption: Data mapping, ICD, security model.
   - Deliverable: Design Package.
3. **Build & SIT**
   - Icon: gears.
   - Caption: Configure SmartAPI, adapters, integration testing.
   - Deliverable: SIT Report.
4. **User Acceptance Testing**
   - Icon: user group.
   - Caption: Finance & Compliance validate flows.
   - Deliverable: UAT Sign-off.
5. **Cutover & Go-Live**
   - Icon: rocket.
   - Caption: Controlled production switch, rollback plan.
   - Deliverable: Cutover Record.
6. **Hypercare**
   - Icon: shield with headset.
   - Caption: Intensive support, 24x7 monitoring.
   - Deliverable: Hypercare Closure Report.
7. **Steady State**
   - Icon: checkmark on document.
   - Caption: Knowledge transfer, governance, quarterly reviews.
   - Deliverable: Operations Sign-off.

### Callouts
- Arrow across top with note: “Typical timeline 10–12 weeks.”
- Gate checkpoints between phases emphasize control and predictability.
- Color bands (blue for active phase, green for completed deliverable).

### Style
- Professional Gantt-like roadmap but simplified for executives.
- Keep icons businesslike, avoid cartoonish feel.

- Escalation path: Delivery Teams → PMO/TDA → Steering Committee.

### Style
- Use organizational chart with clean lines.
- Icons for committee (boardroom table), PMO (calendar/clipboard), TDA (architecture compass), CAB (shield with arrows), Delivery Teams (team silhouettes).
- Color scheme: Blue hierarchy arrows with green highlights on decision points.
