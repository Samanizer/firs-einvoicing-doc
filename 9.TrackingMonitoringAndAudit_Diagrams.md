# Section 9: Tracking, Monitoring, and Audit – Diagrams

This file specifies the visuals required for Section 9. These diagrams must inspire confidence by showing transparency, control, and accountability across Finance, IT, and Compliance. The style should feel enterprise grade, like a SOC/NOC dashboard married with finance reconciliation tools.

## Diagram 23: Three Pane Dashboard

### Intent
Show a unified monitoring console divided into three perspectives — Finance, IT Operations, and Compliance. Each pane highlights the most relevant KPIs and actions for that audience. The diagram should make clear that visibility is role based yet unified in a single platform.

### Canvas Layout
Horizontal split into three panels labeled Finance, IT, Compliance, all feeding from the same SmartAPI core below.

### Elements to Show
- **Finance Panel**
  - KPI tiles: Cleared %, Rejection %, Pending count.
  - Pie chart for rejection reasons (invalid TIN, tax code mismatch, HS code error).
  - Drill down option icon for invoice detail.
- **IT Panel**
  - Latency graph with thresholds.
  - Throughput metric (invoices/min).
  - Error rate indicator with red alert badge if over SLA.
  - Infrastructure health (CPU, memory, queue size).
- **Compliance Panel**
  - Evidence bundles count and integrity status.
  - Daily reconciliation status: Green check if balanced, red cross if mismatched.
  - Audit trail log viewer snippet.
- **SmartAPI Data Layer**
  - Box labeled SmartAPI data streams feeding all three panels.
  - Arrows to each panel.

### Callouts
- Dashboards are real time, role based, and drillable.
- Designed for daily Finance use, IT NOC, and quarterly audits alike.

### Style
- Use KPI tile shapes, charts, and log snippet graphics.
- Blue highlights for Finance, orange for IT, green for Compliance.

## Diagram 24: IT Monitoring Dashboard with Alert Indicators

### Intent
Provide a focused IT view highlighting operational monitoring, thresholds, and alerts. The diagram must appeal to CIOs and IT managers by demonstrating enterprise observability practices.

### Canvas Layout
Single dashboard panel with three sections: Metrics, Alerts, Integrations.

### Elements to Show
- **Metrics Section**
  - Latency graph with P50, P95, P99 lines and SLA threshold at 1.5s.
  - Throughput bar showing current vs max capacity.
  - Error rate panel: HTTP errors, rejection codes, queue length.
- **Alerts Section**
  - Red alert bubble for Latency breach.
  - Amber alert bubble for Certificate expiry approaching.
  - Green check for all other checks.
- **Integrations Section**
  - Icons for ServiceNow, Jira, Teams — showing alert routing into enterprise ITSM/communication systems.
- **Side Panel**
  - Incident history log with correlation IDs and timestamps.

### Callouts
- Active monitoring prevents SLA breaches.
- Alerts integrate into client IT workflows seamlessly.

### Style
- Use line graphs, gauges, and bell icons for alerts.
- Keep ITSM logos small but visible to imply compatibility.

## Diagram 25: Reconciliation Flow

### Intent
Depict how daily and intraday reconciliations compare invoice counts across ERP, SmartAPI, and FIRS, and how mismatches flow into exception queues for Finance review. This diagram demonstrates audit discipline and completeness.

### Canvas Layout
Three boxes in a row: ERP → SmartAPI → FIRS. Below them, an exception queue and reconciliation report path.

### Elements to Show
- **ERP Box**
  - Invoice totals for day (e.g., 10,000 invoices).
- **SmartAPI Box**
  - Count of invoices submitted, processed, cleared, rejected.
- **FIRS Box**
  - Official regulator receipts count.
- **Comparison Lines**
  - Dashed arrows comparing ERP vs SmartAPI vs FIRS counts.
- **Exception Queue**
  - Box below where mismatches are routed.
  - Examples: Missing receipts, duplicate submissions, failed replays.
- **Finance Workflow**
  - Arrow from exception queue → Finance dashboard.
  - Corrected invoices resubmitted automatically.
- **Signed Report**
  - Output: Digitally signed reconciliation report sent to WORM archive.

### Callouts
- Daily reconciliation ensures no hidden mismatches.
- Intraday spot checks for high value invoices reduce financial exposure.
- Reports are audit defensible with signatures and correlation IDs.

### Style
- Use bold numbers to emphasize totals.
- Red arrow for mismatches flowing into exception queue.
- Ledger icon for signed reconciliation report.
