# Section 16: Delivery and Cutover Plan – Diagrams

This file defines the visual for Section 16. The diagram must demonstrate that cutover is a controlled, rehearsed, and reversible process. It should give executives confidence that go-live is predictable and safe.

## Diagram 38: Cutover Timeline

### Intent
Depict the phases of the cutover journey — from pre-cutover readiness, through go-live execution, to hypercare stabilization. The diagram must show both sequencing and safety nets (rollback). It should feel like a mission control plan.

### Canvas Layout
Horizontal timeline divided into five major stages, each with milestone flags. Optional overlay lane below for safeguards (rollback, validation, monitoring).

### Elements to Show

**Stage 1: Pre-Cutover Readiness**
- Icon: checklist.  
- Activities: Runbook finalized, dry-run rehearsal, rollback tested, Steering Committee sign-off.  
- Output: Go/No-Go decision.

**Stage 2: Freeze Window**
- Icon: lock.  
- Activities: ERP integration changes frozen 48 hours before cutover.  
- Output: Stable baseline.  

**Stage 3: Switch & Pilot Batch**
- Icon: switch lever.  
- Activities: Redirect ERP outputs to SmartAPI production.  
- Submit first 50–100 invoices as pilot.  
- Output: IRNs + QRs validated.  

**Stage 4: Full Go-Live**
- Icon: rocket.  
- Activities: Scale to full invoice volume.  
- Real-time monitoring of throughput, clearance rate, error handling.  
- Output: Cleared invoices in production.  

**Stage 5: Hypercare**
- Icon: shield with headset.  
- Activities: 2 weeks intensive monitoring and support.  
- Daily checkpoint calls.  
- SLA tracking (clearance rate > 99%).  
- Output: Hypercare exit criteria met → transition to steady state.  

**Safeguards (lower lane)**
- Rollback plan arrow spanning Stage 3 and 4 with trigger conditions (e.g., clearance < 90%, regulator outage > 12h).  
- Monitoring dashboard icon under Stage 4 & 5.  
- Communication arrow to Finance/Compliance teams throughout.

### Callouts
- Caption: *“Cutover is not a big bang — it is a controlled, reversible process.”*  
- Highlight rollback and pilot batch as risk-reducing mechanisms.  
- Emphasize daily monitoring during Hypercare.  

### Style
- Use enterprise-grade project milestone visuals (flags, checkpoints, gates).  
- Icons: checklist, lock, lever, rocket, shield.  
- Blue gradient timeline with green highlights at successful milestones.  
- Safeguard lane in orange/red to stress risk protection.
