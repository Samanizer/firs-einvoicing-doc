## Diagram 1: One-page Solution Landscape

### Description
A high-level landscape diagram that visually introduces the four solution options (SmartAPI, BlueInvoice, Email Connector, BlueBox) and how they interact with the FIRS MBS platform. This is the “big picture” visual that orients the reader early.

### Elements to Show
- **Left Side (Clients/Enterprises):**
  - Four icons or boxes labeled:
    - *SmartAPI (ERP Integration)*
    - *BlueInvoice (Web Application)*
    - *Email Connector (Email-based Submission)*
    - *BlueBox (Capture Technology)*
  - Each should have a small sub-caption:
    - SmartAPI: “Deep ERP Integration”
    - BlueInvoice: “Browser-based SaaS”
    - Email Connector: “Send Invoices by Email”
    - BlueBox: “Capture from Print/File”

- **Middle Layer (Bluelight Layer):**
  - A large box labeled **Bluelight SmartAPI Compliance Core**.
  - Inside this box, list key functions:
    - Transformation
    - Validation
    - Signing
    - QR Generation
    - Submission
    - Archiving
    - Monitoring & Reconciliation
  - Arrows coming from all four solutions (SmartAPI, BlueInvoice, Email Connector, BlueBox) into this SmartAPI Core.

- **Right Side (Regulator):**
  - A box labeled **FIRS MBS Platform** with a government building or database icon.
  - Output arrows show “Clearance Receipt,” “IRN,” and “QR Code” flowing back to SmartAPI and then to the client solutions.

- **Supporting Notes:**
  - Add a compliance assurance banner across the bottom: *“Secure, Compliant, Future-Proof Integration with FIRS MBS”*.

### Style
- Clean enterprise-style icons (ERP server, cloud for SaaS, envelope for Email Connector, printer for BlueBox).
- Arrows should be unidirectional (submission) and bidirectional (submission + receipt) to show flow.
- Use color coding:  
  - Blue for Bluelight components.  
  - Gray/neutral for client systems.  
  - Green for regulator.
