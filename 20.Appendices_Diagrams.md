# Section 20: Appendices – Diagrams

This file defines the visuals that will be included in the Appendices. These serve as reference artifacts, technical deep-dives, and supporting visuals for evaluators, auditors, and technical teams. They should be clean, standardized, and professional, designed to complement the main sections.

## Diagram 45: Annex Diagram Set Index

### Intent
Provide a summary visual index of all supporting diagrams contained in the appendices. This functions as a “map” for technical reviewers to find supporting content quickly.

### Canvas Layout
Grid layout or stacked icons representing each category of diagrams.

### Elements to Show
- **Solution Landscape**
  - Icon: system architecture graphic.
  - Caption: *SmartAPI, BlueInvoice, Email Connector, BlueBox overview.*
- **Security Architecture**
  - Icon: shield and lock.
  - Caption: *End-to-end encryption, signing, PKI, monitoring.*
- **Data Mapping Flow**
  - Icon: database with arrows.
  - Caption: *Canonical schema, regulator schema mapping.*
- **Integration Decision Tree**
  - Icon: branching arrows.
  - Caption: *ERP maturity → appropriate integration path.*

### Callouts
- Caption at bottom: *“Appendix diagrams provide technical depth and audit assurance.”*
- Optional tag for evaluators: *“Cross-reference with main sections for context.”*

### Style
- Grid of 3x3 or 3x4 boxes with consistent color scheme.
- Use simplified icons with short captions under each.
- Professional look — minimalist, not cluttered.
