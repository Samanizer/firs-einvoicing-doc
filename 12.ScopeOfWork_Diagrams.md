# Section 12: Scope of Work – Diagrams

This file defines the visuals for Section 12. These diagrams must make the scope tangible, showing coverage from requirements gathering through steady-state operations, and how testing validates each stage. The audience should feel that nothing is vague or “black box.”

## Diagram 30: Scope Pyramid

### Intent
Illustrate the full breadth of scope in a hierarchical pyramid, showing foundational activities at the base and higher-value activities (support, knowledge transfer, operations) at the top. The pyramid conveys both progression and dependency — you cannot achieve the higher layers without the base.

### Canvas Layout
Pyramid with five horizontal layers, largest at the bottom narrowing to the top. Each layer labeled with activities, deliverables, and icons.

### Elements to Show
- **Layer 1 (Base): Requirements Gathering & Analysis**
  - Icon: magnifying glass or document.
  - Activities: Stakeholder workshops, ERP landscape analysis, compliance requirements traceability.
  - Deliverable: Requirements Specification.
- **Layer 2: Solution Design**
  - Icon: compass or architecture diagram.
  - Activities: Target architecture, data mapping, security model, integration pattern selection.
  - Deliverable: Solution Architecture Document, ICD.
- **Layer 3: Development & Configuration**
  - Icon: gears or code brackets.
  - Activities: SmartAPI tenant configuration, ERP adapters, BlueBox/Email Connector setup.
  - Deliverable: Configured services ready for SIT.
- **Layer 4: Testing**
  - Icon: test tube or checkmark.
  - Activities: Unit, SIT, UAT, performance, security testing.
  - Deliverable: Test Reports, UAT Sign-off.
- **Layer 5 (Top): Deployment, Training, Support**
  - Icon: shield with people.
  - Activities: Production cutover, training, knowledge transfer, post-implementation support.
  - Deliverable: Go-Live Record, Training Completion, SLA-based support.

### Callouts
- Caption at bottom: *“Strong foundations ensure long-term compliance and stability.”*
- Side note: Each layer outputs deliverables feeding into next phase.
- Optional overlay: Blue highlighting for Softrust/Bluelight responsibilities.

### Style
- Use corporate gradient fill for pyramid layers.
- Place deliverables in bold inside each layer.
- Clean professional icons aligned with enterprise consulting visuals.

## Diagram 31: Testing Cycle

### Intent
Depict how testing is staged to ensure quality, resilience, and compliance. Show each testing type, sequence, and output, emphasizing that coverage is exhaustive and each failure path loops back to correction.

### Canvas Layout
Circular or cyclical flow diagram with five stages connected in a loop. Central caption: “Comprehensive Testing for Assurance.”

### Elements to Show
- **Stage 1: Unit Testing**
  - Icon: gear with checkmark.
  - Scope: Field mappings, transformation functions, validation rules.
  - Deliverable: Unit Test Logs.
- **Stage 2: System Integration Testing (SIT)**
  - Icon: connected nodes.
  - Scope: End-to-end flow ERP → SmartAPI → FIRS Sandbox.
  - Deliverable: SIT Report.
- **Stage 3: User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
  - Icon: user group with checklist.
  - Scope: Finance & Compliance validate real business scenarios, error handling.
  - Deliverable: UAT Sign-off.
- **Stage 4: Performance Testing**
  - Icon: stopwatch or bar chart.
  - Scope: High-volume submissions, latency checks, throughput stress testing.
  - Deliverable: Performance Test Report.
- **Stage 5: Security Testing**
  - Icon: shield with lock.
  - Scope: Authentication, authorization, penetration, certificate expiry checks.
  - Deliverable: Security Test Certificate.

### Flows
- Arrows show progression from Unit → SIT → UAT → Performance → Security.
- Feedback loop arrows from each stage back to Development layer (for correction).
- Central hub labeled: *“SmartAPI Testing Framework.”*

### Callouts
- SIT and UAT involve both client and regulator sandboxes.
- Failures caught early avoid production risk.
- Every stage produces formal deliverables.

### Style
- Circular loop with green for successful progression, red for feedback loops.
- Icons consistent with enterprise QA visuals.
- Clean white background with accent colors for clarity in presentations.
