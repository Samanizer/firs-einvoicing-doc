# Section 14: Systems Requirements by Option – Diagrams

This file defines the visual for Section 14. The objective here is to make it instantly clear which solution option fits which client environment, based on ERP maturity and invoice volume. This is often a key decision-making chart for CIOs and Finance leads.

## Diagram 34: Compatibility Matrix

### Intent
Show a two-dimensional matrix mapping ERP/IT maturity against invoice volume, with each Bluelight solution (SmartAPI, BlueInvoice, Email Connector, BlueBox) positioned in its natural quadrant. This visual reassures clients that **no matter their environment, a fit-for-purpose option exists.**

### Canvas Layout
2D grid (X–Y axis):

- **X-axis (horizontal):** ERP/IT Maturity (Low → High).
- **Y-axis (vertical):** Invoice Volume (Low → High).

Quadrants labeled with recommended solution(s).

### Elements to Show
- **Bottom Left (Low maturity, Low volume)**
  - Icon: envelope.
  - Solution: **Email Connector.**
  - Caption: *Quickest path, no integration required.*
- **Top Left (Low maturity, High volume)**
  - Icon: printer/folder.
  - Solution: **BlueBox.**
  - Caption: *Capture from print or batch without ERP changes.*
- **Bottom Right (High maturity, Low volume)**
  - Icon: browser window.
  - Solution: **BlueInvoice.**
  - Caption: *SaaS for subsidiaries and standalone entities.*
- **Top Right (High maturity, High volume)**
  - Icon: API connector.
  - Solution: **SmartAPI.**
  - Caption: *Deep ERP integration, real-time compliance.*

**Overlay Element**
- Banner across the top: *“All options converge into SmartAPI Core for compliance, monitoring, and archiving.”*
- Small SmartAPI Core icon centered below quadrants with arrows pointing from each solution quadrant to the core.

### Callouts
- Migration-safe: Highlight SAP ECC in left side with arrow to SmartAPI quadrant, showing ECC → S4 path.
- Scalable: Indicate Email Connector or BlueBox can be migrated to SmartAPI when IT maturity grows.
- Coverage caption at bottom: *“Flexible options for every ERP landscape, from Excel and Email to SAP S4/HANA.”*

### Style
- Professional quadrant chart with enterprise blue/green color scheme.
- Clean icons for envelope, printer, browser, and API.
- Bold text labels inside quadrants; keep captions brief but strong.
