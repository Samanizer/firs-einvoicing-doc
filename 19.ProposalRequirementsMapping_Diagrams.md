This file defines the visual for Section 19. The purpose of the diagram is to demonstrate that every client requirement is mapped directly to a section in the proposal — showing completeness and making evaluation effortless for procurement teams.

## Diagram 44: Proposal Requirements Traceability Matrix

### Intent
Present a visual table/matrix showing how each RFP requirement is covered in the proposal. This diagram should look like a consultant’s evaluation aid: structured, clean, and confidence-building.

### Canvas Layout
Two-column (or three-column) table visual. Left column lists client requirements, right column shows corresponding section numbers, optional middle column highlights deliverables. Checkmarks/icons used to show coverage.

### Elements to Show
- **Columns:**
  - Requirement (left).
  - Covered in Section (middle).
  - Highlights (right, optional short notes).

- **Sample Rows:**
  - Company Profile → Section 1, Section 18 → “Global footprint, proven regulator trust.”
  - Project Team & Key Personnel → Section 10, Section 11 → “Dedicated roles, governance framework.”
