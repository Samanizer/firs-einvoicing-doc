# Section 15: Risk Management Approach – Diagrams

This file defines the visuals for Section 15. These diagrams must convey that risk is not theoretical — it is tracked, measured, and actively mitigated with the same rigor as global consulting firms. The visuals should look “board-ready” to impress executives.

## Diagram 35: Risk Management Cycle

### Intent
Show the continuous lifecycle of risk management, reinforcing that it is a living process rather than a one-time activity. The diagram must depict proactivity, iteration, and feedback loops.

### Canvas Layout
Circular cycle with six steps connected clockwise. Center caption: *“Continuous Risk Discipline.”*

### Elements to Show
1. **Identify**  
   - Icon: magnifying glass.  
   - Description: Detect risks in technology, process, and people.  
2. **Assess**  
   - Icon: balance scale.  
   - Description: Score by likelihood and impact.  
3. **Mitigate**  
   - Icon: shield with checkmark.  
   - Description: Implement controls, redesign, or redundancy.  
4. **Monitor**  
   - Icon: radar.  
   - Description: Track indicators, dashboards, alerts.  
5. **Review**  
   - Icon: clipboard.  
   - Description: Steering committee oversight.  
6. **Improve**  
   - Icon: upward arrow.  
   - Description: Feed lessons learned into future plans.  

### Callouts
- Caption: *“Risk management embedded in delivery and operations.”*  
- Emphasize feedback loop arrows (Improve → Identify).  

### Style
- Circular, clean design with corporate color palette.  
- Bold step icons evenly spaced around cycle.

## Diagram 36: Likelihood vs Impact Grid

### Intent
Provide a framework showing how risks are assessed — likelihood on one axis, impact on the other. Must show how risks are scored and categorized.

### Canvas Layout
5x4 grid matrix (Likelihood on Y-axis, Impact on X-axis). Each cell colored Green (low), Amber (medium), Red (high).  

### Elements to Show
- **X-axis (Impact):** Low → Medium → High → Critical.  
- **Y-axis (Likelihood):** Rare → Unlikely → Possible → Likely → Almost Certain.  
- Example risks plotted:  
  - FIRS spec change → High impact, Likely (amber/red).  
  - Poor master data quality → Medium impact, Possible.  
  - ERP integration delays → High impact, Possible.  
  - Security incidents → Critical impact, Almost Certain if unmanaged.  

### Callouts
- Legend: Green (Monitor), Amber (Act), Red (Mitigate immediately).  
- Caption: *“Risks scored by data-driven likelihood and impact.”*  

### Style
- Boardroom-style risk heat map grid.  
- Professional shading from green → amber → red.

## Diagram 37: Risk Heat Map Visual

### Intent
Summarize actual project risks plotted into the heat map, showing priorities for mitigation. Executives should see instantly what’s top of mind.

### Canvas Layout
Same axes as Diagram 36, but with fewer items, plotted as colored circles with labels.

### Elements to Show
- Risks plotted:
  - **Spec Change** (red, high likelihood, high impact).  
  - **Master Data Errors** (amber, possible/medium).  
  - **Integration Delay** (amber, possible/high).  
  - **System Downtime** (red, likely/high).  
  - **Security Incident** (critical, almost certain).  
- Arrows or callouts showing mitigation strategies in place (e.g., “SmartAPI absorbs schema changes”).  

### Callouts
- Caption: *“Top risks already mitigated by design — proactive, not reactive.”*  
- Use arrows from risks to mitigation notes in side panel.  

### Style
- Red/Amber/Green markers with clear labels.  
- Keep uncluttered — focus on top 5 risks only.  
- Executive-ready polish with legend included.
