# Section 17: Operations Runbook – Diagrams

This file defines the visuals for Section 17. These diagrams must communicate operational discipline — how day-to-day processes, incidents, and reconciliations are handled. They should look like playbooks a managed services team would rely on.

---

## Diagram 39: Operations Cycle

### Intent
Show the daily steady-state cycle of operations, from monitoring through to continuous improvement. This diagram should demonstrate that nothing is left unmanaged — each loop has owners and measurable outputs.

### Canvas Layout
Circular loop with six stages connected clockwise. Central caption: *“Runbook-Driven Operations.”*

### Elements to Show
1. **Monitor**  
   - Icon: radar screen.  
   - Description: Dashboards track clearance rates, latency, rejections.  
2. **Detect**  
   - Icon: magnifying glass.  
   - Description: Alerts identify anomalies (spikes, latency breaches, backlog).  
3. **Respond**  
   - Icon: headset.  
   - Description: Ops team acknowledges, initiates playbook.  
4. **Resolve**  
   - Icon: wrench.  
   - Description: Fix applied (resubmission, config correction, replay).  
5. **Reconcile**  
   - Icon: balance scales.  
   - Description: Finance validates cleared vs expected invoices.  
6. **Review & Improve**  
   - Icon: upward arrow.  
   - Description: Lessons learned, RCA feeding continuous improvement backlog.  

### Callouts
- Caption: *“Every step produces a deliverable: alert ticket, fix record, reconciliation report, RCA.”*  
- Emphasize governance: daily, weekly, quarterly reviews layered in.  

### Style
- Circle with six evenly spaced nodes.  
- Blue arrows for main flow, green for improvement feedback loop.

## Diagram 40: Incident Workflow

### Intent
Illustrate the structured workflow for handling incidents of varying severity. Must show escalation layers and SLA commitments.

### Canvas Layout
Vertical swimlane diagram with five steps, Severity bands on the left, Escalation path on the right.

### Elements to Show
- **Step 1: Detect**
  - Event triggers alert (automated or manual ticket).
- **Step 2: Ticket Creation**
  - ServiceNow/Jira integration icons.
  - Correlation ID auto-attached.
- **Step 3: Classify**
  - Severity levels (Sev-1 Critical, Sev-2 Major, Sev-3 Minor, Sev-4 Info).
- **Step 4: Resolve**
  - Assigned to Ops/Integration/SmartAPI teams based on category.
  - Playbook executed (e.g., replay, config correction).
- **Step 5: RCA & Close**
  - Root cause analysis delivered in 5 days for Sev-1/2.
  - Ticket closure approved by PMO.

**Escalation Matrix (Side Panel)**
- Level 1: Client IT/Finance.  
- Level 2: Softrust engineers.  
- Level 3: Bluelight SmartAPI Ops.  
- Level 4: FIRS regulator escalation (last resort).  

### Callouts
- Caption: *“Every incident is logged, traceable, and tied to an SLA.”*  
- Emphasize RCA and closure discipline.  

### Style
- Clean swimlane with roles along the right.  
- Severity bands shaded red (Sev-1), amber (Sev-2), yellow (Sev-3), green (Sev-4).

## Diagram 41: Reconciliation Loop

### Intent
Depict how invoice counts are reconciled daily across ERP, SmartAPI, and FIRS, with mismatches fed into exception queues for Finance to resolve. The diagram must show this as a controlled, auditable process.

### Canvas Layout
Linear top row with ERP → SmartAPI → FIRS, bottom row exception queue and Finance workflow.

### Elements to Show
- **ERP Totals**  
  - Box labeled ERP System.  
  - Example metric: 10,000 invoices issued.  
- **SmartAPI Totals**  
  - Box labeled SmartAPI.  
  - Example metric: 9,950 submitted, 50 in queue.  
- **FIRS Totals**  
  - Box labeled FIRS MBS.  
  - Example metric: 9,930 cleared, 20 rejected.  
- **Comparison Arrows**  
  - Dashed lines comparing counts between ERP, SmartAPI, and FIRS.  
- **Exception Queue (Bottom Row)**  
  - Box labeled Exception Queue.  
  - Contents: mismatches, rejected invoices, unacknowledged submissions.  
- **Finance Workflow**  
  - Finance dashboard icon with arrow from Exception Queue.  
  - Correction and resubmission back into SmartAPI.  
- **Signed Report Output**  
  - Report icon labeled *“Digitally Signed Daily Reconciliation Report.”*  
  - Arrow to WORM archive.  

### Callouts
- Caption: *“Daily reconciliation ensures no invoice is untracked.”*  
- Intraday spot checks for high-value invoices.  
- Compliance assurance: signed reconciliation reports retained for 10 years.  

### Style
- Top row in blue (system counts), bottom row in green (exception management).  
- Red arrow for mismatches flowing into Exception Queue.  
- Ledger icon for reconciliation report.
